<h1>Contribute a Wallpaper</h1>

<p>
  Before submitting a wallpaper, make sure to read these sections
  carefully. Any submission not fulfilling these rules will be rejected.
</p>

<h3>Subject matter</h3>

<p>
  You are free to submit wallpaper covering a wide range of subjects. Not any
  subject, though.
</p>

<p>Allowed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anything related to nature, mountains, rocks, and the like (generally fitting into the "rocky" idea)</li>
  <li>Anything related to the codename (e.g. Blue Onyx)</li>

  <li><strong>Highly Encouraged:</strong> Day and Night versions of wallpapers</li>
</ul>

<p>Discouraged:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Avoid using the Rocky logo, unless it fits with an abstract/minimalist idea for the background
    <ul>
      <li>Plain backdrops with the Rocky logo are <i>not</i> permitted</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Technical requirements</h3>

<p>For general submissions, we require the highest resolution to make things simpler, that way the user should be able to use a wallpaper without having to choose "the right one" for their monitor size. However, for the case of extra backgrounds, this requirement is more relaxed. If a submitter wishes not to use the highest resolution but opts to make multiple resolutions instead, they should follow the below list.</p>

<p><strong>Minimum Required Resolutions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>16:9 (1920x1080)</li>
  <li>16:10 (1920x1200)</li>
  <li>5:4 (2048x1536)</li>
  <li>4:3 (1280x1024)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Additional (Encouraged) Allowed Resolutions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>3440x1440</li>
  <li>2560x1600</li>
  <li>2560x1440</li>
  <li>2560x1080</li>
  <li>1800x1440</li>
  <li>Portrait mode versions of the above are optional</li>
</ul>

<p>The placeholders in <a href="https://github.com/rocky-linux/rocky-logos/tree/962a836f70a131faa541a4f8f73a4a3fddfc3dbf/backgrounds">this commit</a> shows an example of using the minimum resolutions.</p>


<h3>Extras Package</h3>
<p>If a wallpaper does not make it to the main package (whether it doesn't meet guidelines or is simply just Rocky inspired), they should be able to be submitted for addition into the <tt>rocky-backgrounds-extras</tt> package.</p>
